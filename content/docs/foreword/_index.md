- [Pierre Lafaye de Micheaux](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~lafaye/) (Université de Montréal, University of New South Wales, Université de Montpellier) --- especially for Base R contents
- Xinda Yang (University of New South Wales) --- especially for Base R contents and some tidyverse and data visualisation contents
- Johnny Wong (University of New South Wales) --- especially for dplyr contents
- [Alan Xian](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/alan-xian) (University of New South Wales, Macquarie University) --- especially for Base R contents and some tidyverse and data visualisation contents
- [Guillaume Boglioni Beaulieu](https://www.business.unsw.edu.au/our-people/Guillaume-Boglioni-Beaulieu) (University of New South Wales) --- especially for Base R contents and some tidyverse and data visualisation contents

It all started with an initial set of slides on Base R that were created by [Pierre Lafaye de Micheaux](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~lafaye/), and aligned with textbook [The R Software](http://biostatisticien.eu/springeR/index-en.html). Contents were then re-developped and augmented for a first year course taught by [Benjamin Avanzi](http://www.benjaminavanzi.com) collaboratively with Xinda Yang, which was subsequently taught by [Alan Xian](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/alan-xian) and [Guillaume Boglioni Beaulieu](https://www.business.unsw.edu.au/our-people/Guillaume-Boglioni-Beaulieu). The tidyverse, advanced data visualisation, and document generation via R Markdown contents were developed for a data visualisation course by Benjamin Avanzi with the assistance of Arkington Owen.
