# Overview of contents

## Rationale

In many cases, R will be used to communicate data. 

A whole course (or suite of courses) could be dedicated to data communication. This is just an introduction, focusing on how R can support such communication.

When using R, this will involve the following steps:

1. Extract and "Clean" raw data
1. Analyse data and create visualisation
1. Produce them in a chose medium for communication

On this website we explain the basics of how some of those steps can be performed:
1. Manipulate Data
1. Visualise data
1. Produce media

Of course, this all starts with understanding R, so we start with Base R. The structure is reflected on the side.

## Credentials

Those materials were created by the following people, while being employed in the institutions in parentheses

- [Benjamin Avanzi](http://www.benjaminavanzi.com) (University of New South Wales, University of Melbourne) --- for all contents
- [Pierre Lafaye de Micheaux](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~lafaye/) (Université de Montréal, University of New South Wales, Université de Montpellier) --- especially for Base R contents
- Xinda Yang (University of New South Wales) --- especially for Base R contents and some tidyverse and data visualisation contents
- Johnny Wong (University of New South Wales) --- especially for dplyr contents
- [Alan Xian](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/alan-xian) (University of New South Wales, Macquarie University) --- especially for Base R contents and some tidyverse and data visualisation contents
- [Guillaume Boglioni Beaulieu](https://www.business.unsw.edu.au/our-people/Guillaume-Boglioni-Beaulieu) (University of New South Wales) --- especially for Base R contents and some tidyverse and data visualisation contents
- Arkington Owen (University of New South Wales) --- for Base R contents to a limited extent, but especially for the tidyverse, advanced data visualisation contents, and document generation via R Markdown contents

It all started with an initial set of slides on Base R that were created by [Pierre Lafaye de Micheaux](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~lafaye/), and aligned with textbook [The R Software](http://biostatisticien.eu/springeR/index-en.html). Contents were then re-developped and augmented for a first year course taught by [Benjamin Avanzi](http://www.benjaminavanzi.com) collaboratively with Xinda Yang, which was subsequently taught by [Alan Xian](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/alan-xian) and [Guillaume Boglioni Beaulieu](https://www.business.unsw.edu.au/our-people/Guillaume-Boglioni-Beaulieu). The tidyverse, advanced data visualisation, and document generation via R Markdown contents were developed for a data visualisation course by Benjamin Avanzi with the assistance of Arkington Owen.
