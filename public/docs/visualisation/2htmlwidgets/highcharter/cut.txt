## Why do we use bar charts?

- Bar charts one useful form of quantitative data visualisation.
- For each pair of variables, a bar represents one observation, meaning we can easily compare observations by seeing which one is taller
- For example, it becomes easy to visualise the heights of some different coloured aliens with a bar graph!

```{r example, echo = FALSE}
alien_data <- read_csv("sample_data/alien_data.csv") 
library("RColorBrewer")
alien_data %>%
  mutate(colour2 = plyr::mapvalues(
    colour,
    from = c("Red", "Blue", "Green"),
    to = c("#FF0000", "#0040FF", "#01D200")
  )) %>%
  hchart(type = "bar", 
         hcaes(x = name,
               y = height,
               color = colour2))
```
