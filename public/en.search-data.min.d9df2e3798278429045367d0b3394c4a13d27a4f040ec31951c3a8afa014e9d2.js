Contents were then re-developped and augmented for a first year course taught by Benjamin Avanzi collaboratively with Xinda Yang, which was subsequently taught by Alan Xian and Guillaume Boglioni Beaulieu. The tidyverse, advanced data visualisation, and document generation via R Markdown contents were developed for a data visualisation course by Benjamin Avanzi with the assistance of Arkington Owen.\n"});})();
