# blogdown-static

A minimal example of building Rmd files under the `static/` directory of a website based on blogdown and Hugo. See https://blogdown-static.yihui.name for a preview of this example website.

Technical note: this repo contains a submodule, so please `git clone --recursive` to make sure the submodule is also checked out.
